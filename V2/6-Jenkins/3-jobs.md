## What is a Job in Jenkins?

### âœ… Definition:

A **Job** is any **runnable task** that Jenkins manages and executes.
It can range from a **simple shell script** to a **complex multi-stage pipeline** with multiple integrations.
* ðŸ“Œ In official Jenkins documentation, the term **"Job"** is often replaced with **"Project"**.
> ðŸ§  Think of it as an **automated task** or **pipeline step** Jenkins will execute for you.

## What Can a Job Do?

* Pull source code from a repository (like GitHub)
* Compile the code (using tools like Maven or Gradle)
* Run tests and code quality tools
* Package and deploy the application
* Notify teams (email, Slack, etc.)
* And lot more

##  Types of Jobs in Jenkins

### 1. **Freestyle Project**

* Most basic and widely used type.
* Configured using UI.
* Useful for legacy CI/CD jobs.
* Limited customization.

### 2. **Pipeline**

* Uses **Jenkinsfile** written in Groovy-based DSL.
* Supports advanced workflows.
* Ideal for multi-step, multi-node automation.
* More maintainable and version-controlled.

### 3. **Multi-Configuration Project**

* Used for testing in **different environments** or configurations.
* Also known as **Matrix projects**.
* Ideal for platform/OS/browser combinations.

### 4. **GitHub Organization**

* Automatically scans all repos in a GitHub org.
* Detects Jenkinsfiles in each repo.
* Creates and manages jobs per repo automatically.

### 5. **Folder**

* Used to **group jobs/projects** together.
* Helps organize Jenkins dashboard cleanly.
* Not a job itself but acts as a **container**.

### 6. **Multibranch Pipeline**

* Automatically creates a pipeline for **each branch** of a repository.
* Jenkins scans for a Jenkinsfile in each branch.
* Great for feature branch testing and Git workflows.

## Why Understand Job Types?

* Not every task fits in a Freestyle Job.
* Choosing the right job type improves:

  * Reusability
  * Maintainability
  * CI/CD efficiency
  * Scaling across teams and environments
