## Why Jenkins?

### The Problem Before Jenkins:

Before tools like Jenkins existed:

* Developers wrote code â†’ manually tested â†’ manually built â†’ manually deployed.
* This was **slow**, **error-prone**, and **not scalable**.
* Collaboration among teams became chaotic as projects grew.

### Jenkins Solves These Problems By:

* **Automating the build, test, and deployment process.**
* **Integrating** with almost every DevOps tool (Git, Maven, Docker, Kubernetes, etc.)
* **Triggering jobs automatically** (on code push, schedule, etc.)
* Providing **visibility into build pipelines** with logs and status checks.

> ðŸŸ  Jenkins is like a robot that watches your code, tests it, builds it, and ships it â€” all without human intervention.

## What is CI/CD?

### CI â€“ Continuous Integration:

* Developers **frequently push code** to a shared repository (like GitHub).
* Jenkins automatically **builds and tests the code**.
* Ensures the new code **doesnâ€™t break** existing functionality.
* **Goal**: Detect problems early and integrate code frequently.

> Think of CI as making sure everyoneâ€™s code can live together happily â€” **build + test + validate** automatically.

### CD â€“ Continuous Delivery / Deployment:

* After successful CI, Jenkins can **automatically deploy** code to test, staging, or production environments.
* It can be:

  * ðŸ”¹ **Continuous Delivery** â€“ deploy to staging or QA (needs manual prod approval).
  * ðŸ”¹ **Continuous Deployment** â€“ deploy directly to production (fully automated).

> CD ensures your software is **always in a releasable state**.
