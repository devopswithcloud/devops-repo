# GitHub Integration and Authentication: Complete Flow Overview

In this module, we’ll extend the concepts you’ve already learned about **local repositories** and introduce **remote repositories** using GitHub. We'll cover how to set up authentication with **Personal Access Tokens (PAT)** and **SSH keys**, explain the differences between **HTTPS** and **SSH**, and demonstrate how to switch from HTTPS to SSH for Git operations.

---

## Recap of What We’ve Covered So Far:

### 1. Local Repository Setup:
- We learned how to create and initialize a Git repository locally using `git init`.
- We staged changes using `git add`, checked their status with `git status`, and committed them to the local repository using `git commit`.
- We explored the importance of **local repositories** for tracking changes and version control on your machine.

### 2. Understanding Remote Repositories:
- You were introduced to the concept of **remote repositories**, which allow you to share your code, collaborate with others, and securely back up your projects.
- We discussed key benefits such as **collaboration**, **backup**, and **version control in a team setting**.
- We highlighted GitHub as a popular platform for hosting remote repositories.

## Moving Forward: Linking Local to Remote and Handling Authentication

Now, we’ll take your **local Git repository** and link it to a **remote repository** on GitHub. After linking, we’ll explore common authentication issues, and show you how to solve them using either **Personal Access Tokens (PAT)** or **SSH keys**. We will also explain the differences between **HTTPS** and **SSH** and how to switch between the two.

## Part 1: Setting Up GitHub and Adding a Remote

### 1. Create a GitHub Account:
- If you don’t have a GitHub account yet, go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and sign up.
- **Verify your email** after signing up to activate your account.
- You can optionally fill in additional profile details.

### 2. Create a New Repository:
- Once signed in, click the "New" button to create a new repository.
- **Name your repository** (e.g., `AwesomeApp`).
- Decide whether the repository should be **public** or **private**, and initialize it with a README if desired.
- Click **Create repository**.

### 3. Link the Local Repository to the Remote:
In your local project directory (`/home/i27academy/AwesomeApp`), link your local repository to the GitHub repository using the **HTTPS** URL:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/username/AwesomeApp.git
```

**Explanation**:
- This command tells Git to add a new remote repository called `origin`, which points to the GitHub repository.

### 4. Push to GitHub (First Attempt):
Now, attempt to push your local commits to GitHub:

```bash
git push -u origin master
```

**Expected Outcome**:
- The push will **fail** because GitHub no longer supports basic username/password authentication for Git operations over HTTPS.

**Explanation**:
- In August 2021, GitHub discontinued support for password-based authentication for Git operations over HTTPS. Instead, you need to authenticate using either a **Personal Access Token (PAT)** or **SSH keys**.

---

## Part 2: Introducing Authentication Methods

### 1. Why the Push Failed:
- GitHub now requires more secure methods for authentication.
- When pushing over **HTTPS**, GitHub requires either:
  - **Personal Access Token (PAT)**: A token that you generate on GitHub to authenticate instead of using your GitHub password.
  - **SSH Key**: A cryptographic key pair that allows you to push/pull without entering credentials each time.

### 2. Overview of Authentication Methods:
- **Personal Access Token (PAT)**:
  - Used for HTTPS connections.
  - Acts as a replacement for your GitHub password when performing Git operations.
- **SSH Key**:
  - Used for SSH connections.
  - Enables key-based authentication for seamless Git operations without entering credentials each time.

## Part 3: Setting Up a Personal Access Token (PAT)

### 1. Generate a PAT on GitHub:
- Go to **GitHub** → **Settings**.
- On the left-hand side, click **Developer Settings** → **Personal Access Tokens**.
- Click **Generate new token**.
- **Provide a description** for your token (e.g., "Git CLI Access").
- Select an **expiration date** for the token (e.g., 30 days, 90 days).
- Select the **repo** scope to give the token access to your repositories.
- Click **Generate token**.
- **Important**: Copy the generated token and store it in a safe place. You won’t be able to view it again.

### 2. Using the PAT in Git:
When prompted to enter your GitHub password during a push or pull, use the Personal Access Token instead:

```bash
git push -u origin master
```

### 3. Cache the PAT Locally:
To avoid re-entering the PAT every time you perform a Git operation, you can cache your credentials locally:

```bash
git config --global credential.helper cache
```

**Explanation**:
- This command stores your credentials in memory for a limited time (default is 15 minutes).
- You can increase the cache timeout if needed:

```bash
git config --global credential.helper 'cache --timeout=3600'
```

### 4. Push Changes Using PAT:
After setting up the PAT, retry pushing the changes:

```bash
git push -u origin master
```

This time, the push will succeed using HTTPS and your Personal Access Token.

## Part 4: Setting Up SSH Authentication

### 1. Generate SSH Keys:
In your terminal, generate an SSH key pair using the following command:

```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
```

**Explanation**:
- `-t rsa`: Specifies the type of key to generate (RSA is a popular choice for SSH).
- `-b 4096`: Generates a 4096-bit key for stronger security.
- `-C "your_email@example.com"`: Adds your email address to the SSH key as a comment.

- When prompted, press **Enter** to accept the default file location for your key (e.g., `~/.ssh/id_rsa`).

### 2. Add the SSH Key to the SSH Agent:
Ensure that the SSH agent is running, and add your private SSH key:

```bash
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

### 3. Copy Your SSH Public Key:
Copy the SSH public key so you can add it to GitHub:

```bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

### 4. Add the SSH Key to GitHub:
- Go to **GitHub Settings** → **SSH and GPG Keys**.
- Click **New SSH Key**, give it a title (e.g., "Laptop SSH Key"), and paste the public key you copied earlier.
- Click **Add SSH Key**.

### 5. Test the SSH Connection:
Test that everything is set up correctly by running the following command:

```bash
ssh -T git@github.com
```

**Expected Output**:
```
Hi username! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.
```

## Part 5: Understanding HTTPS vs SSH

### 1. Push Again Using HTTPS (Expected Failure):
Even though you’ve set up SSH, your remote URL is still set to HTTPS, so attempting to push will still require a PAT:

```bash
git push -u origin master
```

**Expected Outcome**: This push will fail because you haven't yet switched from HTTPS to SSH.

### 2. Differences Between HTTPS and SSH:
- **HTTPS**:
  - Requires a username and password (or PAT) every time you perform a Git operation.
  - More convenient for beginners but less seamless for frequent Git users.
- **SSH**:
  - Uses key-based authentication, so no password or PAT is required once set up.
  - Ideal for frequent Git operations, as authentication happens automatically.

### 3. Switching the Remote URL to SSH:
To switch your remote from HTTPS to SSH, update the remote URL:

```bash
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:username/AwesomeApp.git
```

### 4. Push Changes Using SSH:
Now that the remote is set to SSH, try pushing your changes again:

```bash
git push -u origin master
```

**Expected Outcome**: The push will succeed using SSH authentication, with no need for a password or PAT.
