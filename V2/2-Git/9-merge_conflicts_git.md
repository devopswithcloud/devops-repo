# Merge Conflicts in Git: Understanding and Resolving Them

A **merge conflict** occurs when Git is unable to automatically merge changes from different branches because the same part of a file has been changed differently in each branch. When this happens, Git will mark the conflict and prompt you to resolve it manually.

---

## **1. When Do Merge Conflicts Happen?**
Merge conflicts typically happen in the following scenarios:
- When merging branches that have overlapping changes to the same lines of code.
- When rebasing a branch onto another with conflicting changes.
- When cherry-picking commits that conflict with the current branch.

---

## **2. Example of a Merge Conflict**

Let’s create a simple example:

1. Assume you are working on a project with two branches, `main` and `feature`.
2. Both branches have changes to the same file, `index.html`, but on the same lines, which will cause a conflict.

---

## **3. Reproducing the Merge Conflict**

1. Switch to the `main` branch and create a commit:
    ```bash
    git checkout main
    echo "Main branch content" >> index.html
    git add index.html
    git commit -m "Update index.html in main branch"
    ```

2. Switch to the `feature` branch and create a conflicting commit:
    ```bash
    git checkout feature
    echo "Feature branch content" >> index.html
    git add index.html
    git commit -m "Update index.html in feature branch"
    ```

3. Attempt to merge `feature` into `main`:
    ```bash
    git checkout main
    git merge feature
    ```

At this point, Git will detect a conflict because both branches modified the same line in `index.html`.

---

## **4. Identifying the Conflict**

When Git encounters a conflict, it will:
- Pause the merge process.
- Mark the conflicting areas in the affected file (e.g., `index.html`).

The conflicting file will look something like this:
```html
<<<<<<< HEAD
Main branch content
=======
Feature branch content
>>>>>>> feature
```

- The content between `<<<<<<< HEAD` and `=======` is from your current branch (`main`).
- The content between `=======` and `>>>>>>> feature` is from the branch you're merging (`feature`).

---

## **5. Resolving the Conflict**

To resolve the conflict, you must manually edit the file:
1. Choose which content to keep, modify, or combine.
2. After editing, remove the conflict markers (`<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`).

### **Example**:
You might decide to combine the content like this:
```html
Main branch content
Feature branch content
```

---

## **6. Marking the Conflict as Resolved**

After resolving the conflict in the file:
1. Add the file to the staging area:
    ```bash
    git add index.html
    ```

2. Complete the merge by committing:
    ```bash
    git commit
    ```

---

## **7. Aborting a Merge**

If you decide you don’t want to continue with the merge, you can abort it:
```bash
git merge --abort
```

This command will stop the merge process and return your branch to its previous state before the merge.

---

## **8. Viewing the Status of a Conflict**

To see which files are in conflict and need resolution, you can run:
```bash
git status
```

This will display a list of files with conflicts and their status.
