# Linux File System Hierarchy

In Linux, the file system is structured in a hierarchical tree with the root directory (`/`) at the top. Understanding this hierarchy is critical for effective navigation, system administration, and file management.

## 1. The Root Directory (`/`)
- The root directory is the topmost directory in Linux. All files and directories stem from it.
- Only the **root** user has write permissions in the root directory. Other users access files and directories within the root hierarchy.

Example:
```bash
cd /     # Change to the root directory
ls /     # List files and directories in the root directory
```

## 2. `/bin` – Essential User Binaries
- Contains essential binary executables (commands) used by all users. These commands are fundamental to booting and repairing the system.
- Examples: `ls`, `cp`, `mv`, `cat`, `bash`.

Example:
```bash
ls /bin   # List commands in the /bin directory
```

## 3. `/boot` – Boot Loader Files
- Contains files necessary for booting the system, such as the Linux kernel, boot loader configuration files, and RAM disk images.
- Examples: `vmlinuz` (Linux kernel), `grub` (boot loader).

Example:
```bash
ls /boot   # List boot-related files
```

## 4. `/dev` – Device Files
- Stores special files that represent hardware devices like hard drives, USB drives, terminals, and printers. These files facilitate communication with hardware devices.
- Examples: `/dev/sda1` (first partition of the hard drive), `/dev/tty` (terminals).

Example:
```bash
ls /dev   # List device files
```

## 5. `/etc` – Configuration Files
- Contains system-wide configuration files for system settings, services, and applications. Almost every system service and application has its configuration file located here.
- Examples: `/etc/passwd` (user accounts), `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` (SSH configuration).

Example:
```bash
ls /etc   # List configuration files
```

## 6. `/home` – User Home Directories
- Each user on the system has a personal directory under `/home` for their files, configurations, and settings. 
- Example: `/home/siva` is the home directory for user "siva."

Example:
```bash
ls /home   # List user home directories
```

## 7. `/lib` and `/lib64` – Essential Shared Libraries
- Contains essential shared libraries required by the executables in `/bin` and `/sbin`. These libraries are similar to dynamic link libraries (DLLs) in Windows.
- Examples: `/lib/libc.so.6` (standard C library).

Example:
```bash
ls /lib   # List shared libraries
```

## 8. `/media` – Removable Media
- This directory is used to automatically mount removable media devices such as USB drives, CDs, and DVDs. When a removable device is connected, it is typically mounted under `/media`.

Example:
```bash
ls /media   # List mounted removable devices
```

## 9. `/mnt` – Temporary Mount Points
- Used by system administrators for temporarily mounting file systems. It is often used to manually mount file systems for tasks like troubleshooting or disk repair.

Example:
```bash
mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt   # Manually mount a device to the /mnt directory
```

## 10. `/opt` – Optional Software
- Contains optional software and packages that are not part of the standard system installation. Third-party and commercial software is often installed here.
- Example: `/opt/google` might contain Google Chrome or other optional applications.

Example:
```bash
ls /opt   # List optional software packages
```

## 11. `/proc` – Kernel and Process Information
- A virtual directory that provides detailed information about system processes and kernel parameters. This directory is dynamically generated and contains real-time system and process information.
- Example: `/proc/cpuinfo` provides detailed information about the CPU.

Example:
```bash
cat /proc/cpuinfo   # View CPU information
```

## 12. `/root` – Root User’s Home Directory
- This is the home directory of the **root** (administrator) user. Unlike regular users, the root user’s home directory is located outside `/home`.

Example:
```bash
ls /root   # List files in the root user's home directory (requires root privileges)
```

## 13. `/sbin` – System Binaries
- Contains essential binaries for system administration tasks, such as commands used by the root user to manage and repair the system.
- Examples: `ifconfig`, `reboot`, `shutdown`.

Example:
```bash
ls /sbin   # List system binaries
```

## 14. `/tmp` – Temporary Files
- Contains temporary files that are used by the system and applications. Files stored here are usually deleted after a reboot.
- Applications use `/tmp` to store short-term data during runtime.

Example:
```bash
ls /tmp   # List temporary files
```

## 15. `/usr` – User Binaries and Read-Only Data
- Contains user-installed programs, libraries, documentation, and source code. It is one of the largest directories on a Linux system and contains essential non-system-critical binaries.
- Subdirectories include:
    - **/usr/bin**: Non-essential command binaries.
    - **/usr/lib**: Libraries for binaries.
    - **/usr/local**: Locally compiled and installed software.

Example:
```bash
ls /usr   # List binaries, libraries, and user programs
```

## 16. `/var` – Variable Files
- Contains files that are expected to change frequently during system operation, such as logs, caches, spools, and temporary files.
- Examples:
    - **/var/log**: Contains system logs.
    - **/var/spool**: Contains tasks waiting to be processed, like print jobs or mail.

Example:
```bash
ls /var   # List variable files, including logs and spools
```
