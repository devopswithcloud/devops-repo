# Viewing File Content in Linux

In Linux, there are several ways to view the contents of a file. Each command serves a specific purpose, from displaying a few lines to viewing the entire file, and even manipulating the order of the content.

## Sample File (`samplefile.txt`) for Demonstration

Letâ€™s create a sample file with some content to use for the examples.

#### Sample File Content (`samplefile.txt`):
```bash
Line 1: DevOps Mastery
Line 2: Linux Basics
Line 3: Git and Version Control
Line 4: Continuous Integration with Jenkins
Line 5: Infrastructure as Code with Terraform
Line 6: Configuration Management with Ansible
Line 7: Docker and Containerization
Line 8: Kubernetes Orchestration
Line 9: Monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana
Line 10: Cloud Deployment with AWS and GCP
Line 11: Security Best Practices
Line 12: DevSecOps Implementation
Line 13: Continuous Delivery with Spinnaker
Line 14: Incident Management with PagerDuty
Line 15: Logging with ELK Stack
Line 16: Networking in Cloud Environments
Line 17: Advanced Kubernetes Features
Line 18: Helm for Kubernetes Packaging
Line 19: GitOps Principles
Line 20: CI/CD Pipelines with Jenkins and GitHub Actions
```

## 1. Using `cat`, `tac`, and `rev` Commands

### Using `cat`:
```bash
cat samplefile.txt
```
- This will display the entire content of `samplefile.txt`.

### Using `tac` (Reverse Line Order):
```bash
tac samplefile.txt
```
**Output**:
```
Line 20: CI/CD Pipelines with Jenkins and GitHub Actions
Line 19: GitOps Principles
Line 18: Helm for Kubernetes Packaging
...
Line 1: DevOps Mastery
```

### Using `rev` (Reverse Each Line):
```bash
rev samplefile.txt
```
**Output**:
```
1:eniL yretsaM spOveD
2:eniL scisaB xuniL
3:eniL lortnoC noisreV dna tiG
...
```

---

## 2. Using `head` Command

#### Example: Display the first 5 lines of `samplefile.txt`
```bash
head -n 5 samplefile.txt
```
**Output**:
```
Line 1: DevOps Mastery
Line 2: Linux Basics
Line 3: Git and Version Control
Line 4: Continuous Integration with Jenkins
Line 5: Infrastructure as Code with Terraform
```

---

## 3. Using `tail` Command

#### Example: Display the last 5 lines of `samplefile.txt`
```bash
tail -n 5 samplefile.txt
```
**Output**:
```
Line 16: Networking in Cloud Environments
Line 17: Advanced Kubernetes Features
Line 18: Helm for Kubernetes Packaging
Line 19: GitOps Principles
Line 20: CI/CD Pipelines with Jenkins and GitHub Actions
```

---

## 4. Using `more` Command

#### Example: View the content of `samplefile.txt` page by page
```bash
more samplefile.txt
```
- **Usage**:
  - Press `Space` to move to the next page.
  - Press `q` to quit.

---

## 5. Using `less` Command

#### Example: View `samplefile.txt` with both forward and backward navigation
```bash
less samplefile.txt
```
- **Usage**:
  - Use `Space` to move forward one page.
  - Use `b` to move backward one page.
  - Press `q` to quit.

## Creating the Sample File for Demonstration:
```bash
cat > samplefile.txt
# Paste the content above or add the content manually
Ctrl + D  # To save and exit
```

| `tac`           | Display file content in reverse line order           | `tac samplefile.txt`                |
| `rev`           | Reverse each line's content                          | `rev samplefile.txt`                |
| `head`          | View the first few lines of a file                   | `head -n 5 samplefile.txt`          |
| `tail`          | View the last few lines of a file                    | `tail -n 5 samplefile.txt`          |
| `more`          | View the content page by page (forward only)         | `more samplefile.txt`               |
| `less`          | View content with forward and backward navigation    | `less samplefile.txt`               |
